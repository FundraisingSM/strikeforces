        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Meet Mohammad and Sahil—two powerchair football players who’ve spent years giving their all on the pitch. 
            Powerchair football isn’t just a sport for them; it’s a passion that’s shaped who they are. 
            But now, they’re facing a significant hurdle...
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, they’re using club chairs—great for regional competition, but not for competing at the national level.
            They need the Strikeforce chair to support their abilities and ambitions.
